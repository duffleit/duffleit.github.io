                <b>My name is David</b>. I'm an Enthusiastic Software Professional, currently based in Vienna and work
                as a freelancer in various
                projects using a bunch of different stacks and environments. I don't sleep too much, do open source and
                prefer keeping my code simple and small instead of clever and edgy. I like sharing my knowledge as
                a speaker at technology conferences and as a lecturer for post-diploma courses at the University of
                Applied Sciences Technikum Vienna.

                I have the strange habit to keep
                <a href="/cv">my curriculum vitae</a> up to date for no reason. It should provide a good overview of
                my experiences and education.

                I love conferences, either as a visitor 👋, speaker 🎤 or organizer 😲.  At the moment, I’m based in Vienna 🎡 and work as
                Freelancer 🙌. You can spend hours in discussing clean code, software architecture or design
                patterns with me. I'm into almost
                everything STEM-related 🌌 and enjoy working on my own ideas 🐣 and solutions ✨ in my spare time. I’m
                engaged in open-source software 🔓 and the community 😍 around it. I avoid working on projects with a
                bus-factor 🚌 of 1. I try to shut down my laptop 💻 and smartphone 📱 on Sundays and love to spend this
                time with my family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 , friends 🎳 , an interesting book 📚 or good eating
                🍜. I’m a big fan of music 🎧 , especially rock and indie 🎸, but due to lack of talent, only enjoy the
                passive listening experience. I prefer the Austrian mountains 🍂 if I need a few days of rest 🙉,
                particularly in good company. During after-work-runs, I like to listen to podcasts 🎙 and gradually improve
                my personal best time 🕙. I try to answer my emails fast, so feel free to ask if you want to know more
                📬.
