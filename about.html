        <p class="top-text">
          <b>My name is David</b>. I'm an Enthusiastic Software Professional,
          currently based in
          <a href="https://youtu.be/JfKKjD0GSZo">Vienna</a> and work as a
          Technical Export
          <a href="https://senacor.com/" target="_blank">@Senacor</a> in various
          projects using a bunch of different stacks and environments. I don't
          sleep too much, do open source and prefer keeping my code simple and
          small instead of clever and edgy. I like sharing my knowledge as a
          speaker at technology conferences and as a lecturer for post-diploma
          courses at the
          <a href="https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/"
            >University of Applied Sciences Technikum Vienna</a

          <span class="bold green"># Personal TL/DR:</span>
          I love conferences, either as a visitor, speaker or
          <a href="http://agiletourvienna.at">organizer</a>. You can spend hours
          in discussing clean code, software architecture or design patterns
          with me. I'm into almost everything

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics"
            >STEM</a
          >-related and enjoy working on my
          <a href="http://nobt.io">own ideas</a> and solutions in my spare time.
          I’m engaged in
          <a href="https://github.com/duffleit">open-source software</a> and the
          <a href="https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/members/179254452/"
            >community</a
          >
          around it. I avoid working on projects with a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus-factor</a> of
          1. I try to shut down my laptop and smartphone on Sundays and love to
          spend this time with my family, friends, an
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74000734-david-leitner"
            >interesting book</a
          >
          or good eating. I’m a big fan of music, especially rock and indie, but
          due to lack of talent, only
          <a href="http://last.fm/user/duffleit">
            enjoy the passive listening experience</a
          >. I prefer the Austrian mountains if I need a few days of rest,
          particularly in good company. During after-work-runs, I like to listen
          to <a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/">podcasts</a> and gradually
          improve my personal best time. I try to answer my emails fast, so
